""" 
The script by IP uses an IP address to determine the location, 
which can be different from the physical location of the device.
To get the physical location of the device, its necessary to
use other methods such as GPS or WiFi triangulation.
 However, these methods typically require access to the
device itself and may not be possible in all situations.
    
One way to do this is by using a combination of WiFi triangulation and geolocation
APIs. Here's an example script that uses the Google Maps API to get the physical
location of a device based on WiFi network information
